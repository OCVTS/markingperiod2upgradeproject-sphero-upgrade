                <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this program is to travel on the edges of floor tiles, using the vertex of four floor tiles as coordinates. You can use these coordinates to move the robot to specific places throughout the room easily by passing functions that move toward these grid points in a straight line, moving along the edges of the tiles.</p>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>There was a lot of trial and error during the development of my project. One notable change was that it began as block code, which was then transformed into javaScript, and the rest of the project was based on that resulting javaScript.</p>
